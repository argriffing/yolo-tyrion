===========

The repo name is from github's autosuggest and it was too funny.

This repository will eventually have some source code
related to population genetics models,
focusing on joint evolution of RNA site pairs
and the computation of population joint allele frequencies at equilibrium.
Eventually this code will be abandonded because it is just research code
as opposed to a library useful for developers or an app useful
for anyone else.
